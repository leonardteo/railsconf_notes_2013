# Hacking the Academic Experience

Emily Stolfo, @EmStolfo

## Problem

Even with a CS degree, I didn't really learn how to program until I was doing a Master's degree.

## Academia and Hacking

Developing a hacker-centric curriculum.

Getting involved as a hacker.

Hacker term is loaded. It can be used both positively and negatively. We're focusing on the positive incarnation.

You need programmers to be teachers.

## Few things that helped me be successful

* Example projects
* Internet
* Trying things out
* Books
* Colleagues
* Community
* Users

## But should academic curriculum reflect industry trends?

* Foundations of Computer Science are essential
* A generation in tech is shorter than other subjects

## As opensource contributors, we can contribute more than just code

## 5 Hacker Habits

1. Treat the internet as your textbook. Google is your friend.
2. Ability to debug code you didn't write.
3. Build something to solve a real-life problem.
4. Engage with the community (in person and at meetups). Engaging the community through code. Pull requests, etc.
5. Thinking critically about code. Not just copy pasting code. Understanding it.
