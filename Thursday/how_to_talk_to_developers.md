## Talks have to reach out and grab people

Introduction

I introduced myself and asked people to stand up.

Throw something weird at them.

Live demonstration with people

It is more important to be entertaining than informative.

You have to be more interesting than the Internet! People have laptops!

People love the story they know. Present it well.

When a reporter creates a piece for a newspaper, it's a sepcific way. Each paragraph builds on the previous one. The dependency builds upwards. That's so that the Editor can cut the piece at any time and it's still a complete article. Write your talk that way. Say the most important thing first.

Show don't tell!

Live coding is interesting!

## Body Language

Tall posture. Confident.

Struggle with hands. The natural tendency is to fold hands. Best default posture is to have hands out.

## People like stories

People like stories if your code is worse than their code.

## Nervousness

Talks are agitating. 

Power pose! When you act like you are confident, your brain gets tricked into it. Power poses!

If you're depressed or having negative thoughts, power pose!

Nodder - talk to the nodder. :)

## Anti-patterns

Don't be crazy over excited. 

Really care about it. Good information. Empassionate delivery

Don't say "Can you read this?"

Pre-apologizing. "This is my first talk. I'm really nervous. etc".

"You guys get this right?"

When asking a question, put your hands behind your back. Move towards the person talking.

## COnferences

Ask to speak not on the last day.

Don't ever give talks in giant rooms. Get the smallest room. Nobody likes a half full nightclub. Ask for small room.
