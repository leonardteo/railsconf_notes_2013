On the net, we can scale easily. The scale exists. The holy grail for web developers is that we have a black box that makes a lot of money.

## Software

* Agile development
* Rapid iteration
* Continuous deployment

Speed. 

We need to collect metrics to make sure that what you are doing is actually working.

This is an optimization issue. 

Outcompete your competitors.

## Basic A/B testing

Skeptical? You might be surprised! We see improvements of 1-3%. Just keep testing and testing. Eventually keep improving and over time and aggregate it does work.

## Low risk low cost 

If you come up with something, just put it up and see how it goes.

## What to test

What features do your customers want?

What is the simplest version of the feature that you can build to gauge interest?

What are your customers willing to pay for?

What are free and require an upgrade? Can you trivially move paywalls around?

How much will they pay?

Are we undercharging?

When and how often should we re-market to users?

Are you over-saturating your users or are missing possible sales opportunities?

Test every new user-facing feature.

## Examples

How do we get users to receive more messages?

How do we get more users to post more?

## Your whole business is a conversion funnel

We've seen huge boosts in revenue and conversion rates.

## Technical debt

Code has to work in both systems.

Automated testing *is* essential.

All code needs to be held to the same standard of rigor.

Kill dead code immediately. Don't leave stuff that you decide not to use around.

## Takeaways

* Rapid dev is useless if you're not moving in the right direction
* Tiny improvements over time compound
* Let data inform your decisions
* There are tools at your disposal

## Questions

How do you test before you build a feature?
How do you test without changing something fundamental that becomes a policy?
