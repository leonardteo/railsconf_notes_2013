## Why people don't read your docs

People don't read. 

Jakob Nielson "How users read on the web". Conclusion is that people scan. They don't read. 

F shaped pattern for reading web content. Top left, scanning down.

What people read:

* Meaningful text and images
* Beginnings of paragraphs
* Bullet lists
* Variations in typefaces

People don't read marketing copy.

Text has to be scannable.

Transgressions:

* Fixed width texts like Courier New. Difficult to scan.
* Banner blindness. Things that look like banners are ignored.
* Long lines. Lines have to be short.
* Assuming a linear structure/style. Users want specific questions to their answers. Don't use pages.
* Not writing code examples that are real code that works. Users typically just copy/paste the code in
* Putting documentation behind a wall. Don't!

Good stuff:

* Break up content into small chunks
* Meta structures - add Step 1, 2, etc. in the titles
* Table of contents
* Verbs. People like using verbs and search for verbs.
* Have real errors in flash messages etc. Don't just have catch all errors.

## Users are really bad at searching

Think about a user's mental models and what search terms they might have.


## How to look at things from a user's perspective

What are your users trying to do?

If users get an error message a lot, put the exact text in your documentation. It will get picked up by Google.
