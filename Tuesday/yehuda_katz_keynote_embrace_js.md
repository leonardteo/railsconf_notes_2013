# Embrace Javascript

Yahuda Katz, Tilde, Creator EmberJS

Get over yourself. Embrace JS. 

Most of the talk was just an inspirational talk about the shift from document-based apps with a sprinkling of Javascript to apps that are Javascript heavy.

Frameworks like Sproutcore are bad. They try to take over everything. You want something where you can define HTML as an application UI, then make JSON requests to get data and work with them. That's how Ember works.
