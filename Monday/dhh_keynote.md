# DHH Keynote

Rails 4 is now RC1.

Good frameworks are extractions, not inventions. Build for what you actually need, not what you **think** other people need.

Good software takes 10 years to make.

Convince innovators and early adopters first. Don't bother targeting the middle of the wave.

The rest of the keynote was a tour of Rails 4.
