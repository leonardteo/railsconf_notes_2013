## Stables and Volatiles

Was at Apple 8.5 years. Ran part of the Mac OS X team. Ran the store. At Palentier, working on making Big Data accessible.

## You're in a hurry

Your gig has an expiration date. Every 3 years, people switch jobs. We get bored. We figure out the problem. We solve things then go "What's next?".

"1.0 is going to kill you." Not easy. And it sucked. You're bringing something that doesn't exist into the world.

## Regarding "Disruption"

This is a stupid marketing term. Applied after the fact. People say that it's new but it's been happening for decades.

William Shockley

Invented the transister but was an asshole. 

His henchmen left and founded semiconductor companies in Silicon Valley that had an egalitarian attitude. Why? Because their previous boss was a jerk. Flat structure. Open concept workspaces. Results orientation. 

We as engineers care about value creation. Can you build value and discern it.

The Zuckerburg phase of today was actually created 40 years ago.

## Risk Takers. 

1/10 startups are successful. Why? We are learning.

## There's a spectrum to these builders

Archetypes:

* Stables
* Volatiles

# Stables

* Happily work
* Like schedules
* Play nice with others
* Calmly assess risk
* Carefully work to mitigate failure
* Generate process because process creates predictability and measurability

Salient indecision making. The most recent information gets the most disproportionate weighing.

# Volatiles

* Pain in the asses
* Define strategy rather than follow it
* Cannot conceive a failing and find thrill in a risk
* Don't build predictable or stable things, but they build a lot
* Only reliable if it's in their best interest
* See working with others as time consuming. Want to work in small, autonomous teams.
* Don't give a shit how you feel

# Allergic reations

* These folks hate each other
* Volatiles believe stables are slow, lazy, political, beaurocrats
* Stables believe volatiles hold nothing sacred

# Bad News

* Everyone's right. :)
* If you want a team that's growing, you need a world where they can thrive.

A lot of companies unintentionally kill their volatiles.

The reward for shipping 1.0 is a curse.

1.0 was crazy. But they did it anyway. But it transformed their industries.

# Volatiles become stables. 

What happens is they ship. 1.0 is hard. It's war. It gets done. Then you get protective of that.

Danger. Danger. Warning. Volatiles show up and start trying to do things. Old volatiles tell new volatiles to shut up.

Companies die when volatiles leave.

# Do you or do you not want flying toasters?

Apple has a history of throwing things away?

If you don't disrupt yourself, someone else will disrupt you!

Apple doesn't want to become stable.

You need both.

You need stables for credibility, repeatability.

You need volatiles to change stuff.

# Build a world where both stables and volatiles thrive

Build an appreciation of the other side of the fence.

Distribute blank slates

Equal representation of and investment in stables and volatiles.

Stagnation = Death
